; str function will create a single string out of all its arguments
(str "Hello" " " "World")

; Math is straightforward
(+ 1 1)
(- 2 1)
(* 1 2)
(/ 2 1)

(not true) ; equals False
(not false) ; equals True

; Nesting forms works how we expect to do
(+ 1 (- 3 2));


; Clojure uses Javas object types, most different is "null" since Clojure recognizes as "nil"

'(+ 1 2)
